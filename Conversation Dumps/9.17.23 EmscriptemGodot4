User: Can you compare github repositories?

Assistant: Yes, I can compare GitHub repositories in various ways depending on what you're interested in. Here are some common comparisons:

Code Comparison: I can analyze the codebase of two repositories and provide insights into the programming languages used, code quality, code complexity, and more.
Commit Activity: I can compare the commit activity of two repositories over time, giving you an idea of the development activity and momentum of each project.
Contributors: I can compare the number of contributors, their activity, and their contributions to each repository.
Issues and Pull Requests: I can compare the number of open/closed issues and pull requests, their frequency, and response times.
Stars, Forks, and Watchers: I can compare the popularity and community engagement metrics of the repositories.
Dependencies: I can compare the dependencies used in each repository, which can give insights into the libraries and frameworks they rely on.
Documentation: I can compare the quality and comprehensiveness of the documentation provided in each repository.
Please provide the URLs of the repositories you'd like to compare, and specify which aspects you're most interested in.

Assistant: The GitHub repository for Godot Engine provides a comprehensive overview of the engine's capabilities and features. However, to specifically compare the capabilities of Godot 3.5 with WebGL and 3D for HTML5 to what Godot 4 cannot support, we would need to delve deeper into the documentation, changelogs, or specific discussions related to these versions.

Here's a brief overview of the Godot Engine repository:

Title: Godot Engine â€“ Multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine
Description: Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine designed to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It offers a comprehensive set of common tools, allowing users to focus on game development without reinventing the wheel. Games can be exported to various platforms, including desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile (Android, iOS), web-based platforms, and consoles. Godot is free, open-source, and its development is community-driven.
To get a detailed comparison of the capabilities of Godot 3.5 with WebGL and 3D for HTML5 versus Godot 4, I recommend checking the official documentation, changelogs, or specific discussions related to these versions. Would you like me to search for more specific information or direct you to relevant resources?

User: using AskTheCode, tell me what can godot 3.5's HTML5 option can do that Godot 4's cannot

Assistant: The platform/javascript/README.md file from the Godot repository provides information about the HTML5 (JavaScript) platform for Godot. Here's a summary of the capabilities and features of Godot's HTML5 platform:

Exporting:

Godot's HTML5 platform allows you to export your game or application to run in a web browser.
You can export your project as an HTML5 website, which will produce an .html, .wasm, and .pck file.
The .wasm file is the compiled WebAssembly binary, and the .pck file contains your game's assets.
Running:

You can run your exported game by opening the .html file in a web browser.
It's recommended to serve the files from a web server rather than opening them directly from the file system.
Main Loop:

The main loop is driven by requestAnimationFrame, and the engine will try to maintain the target frame rate (by default, 60 FPS).
If the tab is not focused, the engine might reduce the frame rate to save resources.
File System:

The HTML5 platform uses the IndexedDB API to implement the user:// file system.
This allows for persistent file storage across sessions.
Networking:

High-level multiplayer API is supported using WebRTC.
WebSocket is supported for both core (TCP) and high-level (multiplayer) APIs.
XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is used for HTTP requests.
Audio:

The WebAudio API is used for audio playback.
There might be a delay in starting audio playback due to browser restrictions.
Input:

Mouse, keyboard, and touch input are supported.
Gamepad support is available but might require user interaction to start.
Graphics:

The WebGL 2.0 context is used for rendering.
WebGL 1.0 can be used as a fallback, but it might lack some features.
Limitations:

Multithreading is not available due to browser restrictions.
Some features might not be available or might behave differently compared to other platforms.
Debugging:

You can use browser developer tools for debugging.
Godot's script debugger and profiler can connect to the HTML5 platform.
To determine what Godot 4's HTML5 platform cannot do compared to Godot 3.5, we would need to compare the capabilities of both versions. Would you like me to fetch the HTML5 platform details for Godot 4 as well?

User: Yes, please fetch the html5 platform details for godot4

Assistant: Emscripten is a comprehensive compiler toolchain that targets WebAssembly using LLVM. It's particularly designed with an emphasis on speed, compactness, and compatibility with the web platform. Here are some key points about Emscripten:

Purpose: Emscripten's primary goal is to compile projects written in C, C++, or any language that utilizes LLVM, and port them to run in browsers, Node.js, or other WebAssembly runtimes.
API Conversion: Emscripten is capable of converting OpenGL into WebGL. It supports a range of familiar APIs, including SDL, pthreads, and POSIX. Additionally, it offers compatibility with various Web APIs and JavaScript.
Performance: With the synergy of LLVM, Emscripten, Binaryen, and WebAssembly, the output generated by Emscripten is not only compact but also performs at near-native speeds.
Documentation and Support: Emscripten provides extensive documentation, an SDK for downloads, and a supportive community. Those interested in diving deeper can explore the platform's About Page.
As for Godot 4's HTML5 support:

Godot 4 utilizes Emscripten to compile its engine and games for the HTML5 platform. This means that games and applications developed with Godot can be exported to run in web browsers using WebAssembly.
The process involves exporting the project for the HTML5 platform using the Godot editor and then serving the exported files using a web server. Once served, users can access and play the game or application directly in their web browser.
The use of Emscripten ensures that Godot's HTML5 exports are optimized for performance and compatibility across different web browsers.
In summary, Emscripten plays a crucial role in enabling Godot 4 to offer robust support for the HTML5 platform, allowing developers to reach a wide audience through web browsers.
