**ChatGPT:**  
The repository "GIPowered" contains the following files:
1. [.obsidian/app.json](https://github.com/T4nkUwU/GIPowered/blob/master/.obsidian/app.json)
2. [.obsidian/appearance.json](https://github.com/T4nkUwU/GIPowered/blob/master/.obsidian/appearance.json)
... [and so on for the rest of the files]

It appears that the repository is related to Obsidian configurations and a conversation dump in markdown format. 

How can I assist you further with this repository?

**User:**  
We're going to build out the ideas under each of the markdown files in the "Technologies" folder. We're also adding this conversation to "Conversation Dumps" in a markdown file using the same naming structure as the other markdown file in that folder. Please suggest a name for this conversation as a file.

**ChatGPT:**  
It seems that there is no "Technologies" folder in the provided repository. Therefore, I cannot retrieve the markdown files from that folder.

However, for naming the conversation file in the "Conversation Dumps" folder, based on the existing naming structure "9.17.23 Start.md", I suggest the following name for this conversation:

`9.17.23 ChatGPT.md`

Would you like to proceed with this name or suggest another one?

**User:**  
that's a fine suggestion. What other folders do you see in this repository?

**ChatGPT:**  
Based on the current structure of the repository, the only identifiable folder is:
- [Conversation Dumps](https://github.com/T4nkUwU/GIPowered/tree/master/Conversation%20Dumps)

Additionally, there's a `.obsidian` directory which seems to contain configuration files for the Obsidian application.

Would you like to explore the contents of the "Conversation Dumps" folder or any other specific action related to the repository?

**User:**  
https://github.com/T4nkUwU/GIPowered/tree/master/Technologies

**ChatGPT:**  
It seems there are no files in the "Technologies" folder at the moment, or the folder might not exist in the repository. 

Would you like to perform any other actions or explore different parts of the repository?

**User:**  
https://github.com/T4nkUwU/GIPowered/blob/master/Technologies/BabylonJs.md

**ChatGPT:**  
I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems that the file "BabylonJs.md" in the "Technologies" folder either does not exist or exceeds the character limit for retrieval.

If the file is particularly large, I won't be able to directly fetch its content due to limitations. However, you can provide a brief overview or specific sections you'd like to focus on, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Would you like to explore other parts of the repository or proceed in a different manner?

**User:**  
I wonder if I found a bug. That folder contains a selection of files that are all empty. I wonder if GPT chose to ignore it.

**ChatGPT:**  
It's possible. If the "Technologies" folder contains multiple empty files, the system might not retrieve or display them as there's no content to show. This could be interpreted as the files not existing, especially if they are empty.

If you have specific actions or tasks you'd like to perform with these empty files or if you have other questions about the repository, please let me know. I'm here to help!

**User:**  
Can you give me an example of a top down checklist of "Goals to accomplish with the following technology"
Send me it in markdown format.
I'm looking for the following.
[Name of Technology] is used for [use case for technology]. We will be using [Technologies' favored language].

**ChatGPT:**  
Certainly! Here's an example of a top-down checklist in markdown format for a hypothetical technology:
```markdown
# Goals to Accomplish with [Name of Technology]
... [and the rest of the checklist]
You can replace the placeholders ([Name of Technology], [use case for technology], and [Technologies' favored language]) with the specific details you have in mind.
