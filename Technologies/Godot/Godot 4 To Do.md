### **To-Do: Test 3D Assets in Godot Web Export**

- [ ] **1. Setup Godot Project**:
   - [ ] Create a new Godot project.
   - [ ] Import textured, animated character assets into the Godot project.

- [ ] **2. Design a Simple Scene in Godot**:
   - [ ] Place the textured, animated character in a Godot scene.
   - [ ] Add basic camera controls in Godot to navigate around the scene.
   - [ ] Implement Godot scripts to animate or interact with the character.

- [ ] **3. Transition between Vulkan and WebGL**:
   - [ ] Work with the Godot project using Vulkan for the Windows and Android versions.
   - [ ] Transition to using WebGL and Emscripten for the web version.

- [ ] **4. HTML5 Export with Emscripten**:
   - [ ] In Godot, navigate to `Project > Export`.
   - [ ] Add an `HTML5` export preset.
   - [ ] Under the `Export Options`, ensure `Emscripten` is selected.
   - [ ] Configure any other necessary settings specific to your project.
   - [ ] Export and test the Godot project in multiple web browsers to ensure compatibility and performance.
   - [ ] Host the exported HTML5 game on a server or platform of choice to test real-world loading and performance.

- [ ] **5. Other Exports**:
   - **Windows**:
     - [ ] Configure the Godot export settings for Windows using Vulkan.
     - [ ] Test the game on a Windows machine to ensure smooth performance and correct asset rendering.
   - **Android**:
     - [ ] Configure the Godot export settings for Android using Vulkan.
     - [ ] Test the game on actual Android devices to ensure smooth performance and correct asset rendering.

- [ ] **6. Documentation**:
   - [ ] Document any challenges or issues faced during the Godot export process.
   - [ ] Note down solutions or workarounds implemented for each challenge in Godot.
   - [ ] Create a Godot guide or tutorial for the team on how to export 3D assets for various platforms using Godot 4.
