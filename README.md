## Generative Intelligence (GI) Based Notebook
Welcome to this unique notebook, where we harness the power of **Generative Intelligence (GI)** to facilitate and document the process of learning.

## NOTES
9.17.23 - https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.1.1/ < This is the version of Godot we are using 

## What is This Notebook?

This notebook is a collection of ideas that Rafi has decided to chase. He's asking a GI how to do things, learn things and create things and it's giving him the answers. It's much smarter than him and capable of producing results faster, so instead we will be copying and pasting all of the GI's answers into this notebooks so that it's easier to learn from.

## What are we trying to learn?

1. **Node Databases(neo4j)**: Rafi wants to learn how to use node databases because they are more efficient than SQL or Tables. Rafi believes this will allow for more efficent games as a services technologies, giving users faster results and larger data pools to work with.
2. **Bun**: Bun is a new website compiler. Rafi is interested in learning how to use Bun with Vue.Js, Typescript, and Godot. The goal is to create a software stack and game engine that creates combination monitor and mobile games (like jackbox games) that reflect complicated and fun board games.
3. **Declaritave Languages**: Python and GDScript are non-declarative languages. Rafi wants to force both of these languages to be declaritive in his work.  This will allow for more efficent code and more efficent games.
4. **Solving Turn-Based Games**: The games that Rafi is currently designing are turn-based. Rafi wants to use GI to map and understand his favorite boardgames, while also using AI like Monte Carlo Tree Search to solve his own games. 

## Documenting the Learning Process

This notebook serves as a record of our journey through the vast landscape of knowledge. Here's how we'll document our learning:

- **Conversation dumps**: Many of these ideas will start by asking GPT questions and learning from the results. We'll include the questions and answers in the notebook.
- **Reflections**: Periodically, we'll take a moment to reflect on what we've learned, noting down insights and realizations.
- **Links & Resources**: If there are external resources or links that can enhance our understanding, they'll be included in the notebook.
- **Progress Trackers**: We'll maintain a log of topics covered, ensuring that we're moving forward in our learning journey.
